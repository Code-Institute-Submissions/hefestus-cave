1. In the desired repository, click on "Settings" from the top menu.
2. From the side menu to your left, select "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section.
3. Make sure the "Source" option is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the desired "Branch" from the drop down below (main branch in most cases, making sure the director is set to /(root)).
5. Select "Save", and after it refreshes the page, you will see a box at the top of the page providing you with the URL of your now published site.

To contribute or check the code yourself, you can fork or clone the repository as well.

### Fork
1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click "Fork" in the upper right corner
3. Select the owner, and set the repository name. A description can be added if desired
